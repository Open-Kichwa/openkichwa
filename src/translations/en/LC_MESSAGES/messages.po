"I have previously spent 4 years learning Japanese and after an amazing "

"a bit in Kichwa. After talking to more people from indigenous communities"
" I found myself more interested in the Culture and Language. I became "
"quite aware of what is going on in Ecuador and how Kichwa is slowly "
"disappearing. I find it sad that the proficiency in Kichwa of young "
"people is decreasing. I hope to be able to create a useful project that "
"will empower more research and development of better learning resources "
"for Kichwa. I want Kichwa to not be my own project for ever, I want it to"
